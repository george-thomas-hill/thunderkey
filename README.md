# Thunderkey

This is the source code for [Thunderkey](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/thunderkey), a Thunderbird extension.

## Features

Thunderkey lets you perform common email tasks using keyboard shortcuts.

You can:

* Scroll a message up or down without leaving your main window's messages list.

* Navigate up or down one folder at a time.

* Jump to your favorite folders.

* File messages in those folders.

* File your last-sent message.

* Create new folders.

All shortcuts can be customized.

## Installation

If you wish to install this extension, it is best to install it from within Thunderbird.

In Thunderbird's menu bar, select Tools > Add-ons.

In the search box, search addons.thunderbird.net for "Thunderkey".

## Support

If you encounter any problems, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/george-thomas-hill/thunderkey/issues).

## Known Issue

* Changes made with this extension—like filing a message in a folder—aren't noticed by Thunderbird's undo/redo system. This is a limitation built into Thunderbird and we can't change it through this extension.

## Dependencies and Attributions

* [Bootstrap v. 4.0.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) is used to style the extension interface. It is used under the [MIT License](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4.0.0/LICENSE).
