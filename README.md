# Thunderkey

This is the source code for [Thunderkey](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/thunderkey), a Thunderbird extension.

## End-of-Life?

UPDATE, July 11, 2022: Though Thunderkey installs on Thunderbird 102.0, some functionality does not work correctly, and Thunderkey will likely not install at all on subsequent versions of Thunderbird. For more information, see: https://github.com/george-thomas-hill/thunderkey/issues/2

## Features

Thunderkey lets you perform common email tasks using keyboard shortcuts.

You can:

* Scroll a message up or down without leaving your main window's messages list.

* Navigate up or down one folder at a time.

* Jump to your favorite folders.

* File messages in those folders.

* File your last-sent message.

* Create new folders.

All shortcuts can be customized.
