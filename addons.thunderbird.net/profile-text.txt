Description:

Thunderkey lets you perform common email tasks using keyboard shortcuts.

You can:

* Scroll a message up or down without leaving your main window's messages list.

* Navigate up or down one folder at a time.

* Jump to your favorite folders.

* File messages in those folders.

* File your last-sent message.

* Create new folders.

All shortcuts can be customized.

Mozilla requires us to disclose how Thunderkey collects, uses, and stores user data.

Thunderkey only collects the information that you provide to it through the options page; Thunderkey stores that information on your hard drive.

More information is in our Privacy Policy.

Known Issue:

* Changes made with this extension—like filing a message in a folder—aren't noticed by Thunderbird's undo/redo system. This is a limitation built into Thunderbird and we can't change it through this extension.

Privacy Policy:

Mozilla requires us to disclose how Thunderkey collects, uses, and stores user data.

Thunderkey only collects the information that you provide to it through the options page.

This information is limited to your choice of shortcuts and your selections of favorite folders.

This information is necessary for Thunderkey to respond correctly when you use a keyboard shortcut.

The information is stored on your computer's hard drive.

It does not leave your computer (unless, for example, you use some kind of backup or file-synchronization service).

If you do not provide this information, Thunderkey will use only the default keyboard shortcuts.
